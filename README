# About
CoC-CharGen is a character generator for Call of Cthulhu (CoC) for both PCs (player characters) and NPCs (non-player characters). It supports 1890's, 1920's, and 1990's versions of the game. It's goal is to be:
* Universal - it's coded in good ol' PHP!
* Easy to use - just click a button!
* Expandable - a MySQL backend allows adding more names, places, colleges, and other information.
